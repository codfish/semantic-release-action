## CI/CD Pipelines

- Release workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml` dogfoods the action and builds multi-platform Docker images.
- Validation workflow: `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs on PRs and performs dry-run testing.

Guidance:
- Ensure changes remain compatible with both AMD64 and ARM64 build matrix.
- Keep validation fast and reliable; prefer dry-run checks over full releases in PRs.
