## Project Overview

This repository contains a Docker-based GitHub Action that wraps `semantic-release` to provide automated semantic versioning and releasing. The action exports version information as both GitHub Action outputs and environment variables for use in subsequent workflow steps.

- Prefer solutions that keep the action minimal and reliable inside a Docker container.
- Maintain compatibility with both AMD64 and ARM64 where relevant.
- Ensure changes preserve the dual output system (GitHub outputs and environment variables).
- Keep the entry point a single process: `node /action/entrypoint.js`.
