## Code Quality and Conventions

- Use `cod-scripts` for linting, formatting, and testing.
- Follow Conventional Commits; commit messages are linted via commitlint.
- Husky pre-commit hooks should pass locally.

When proposing edits, keep changes minimal, readable, and aligned with existing style. Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.
