## Testing Strategy

- Minimal unit tests exist in `entrypoint.spec.js`.
- Extensive integration testing happens via dogfooding in CI workflows.
- Use dry-run mode to validate changes with various configurations in the validation workflow.

Guidance:
- Prefer adding/adjusting tests that run in CI (dry-run) when changing release behavior.
- Add focused unit tests for edge cases in parsing, dynamic installs, and output formatting.
